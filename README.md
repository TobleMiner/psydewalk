PSYDEWALK
=========

Notes:
- Behaviors have a loose ordering via AFTER dependency
- Behaviors are carried out at certain places
- Transports connect places
- Transports use behaviors to simulate movement
- Each behavior has a associated mode, e.g. Pedestrian
- Modes have their own behaviors
- These behaviors activate for a maximum given amount of time controlled by the main behavior
